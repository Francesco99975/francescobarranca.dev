      ("Developer"), and
      <span>{{client_name}}</span>, an individual or entity with a mailing
      address at

      ("Client"), collectively referred to herein as the "Parties". Developer is
      an independent contractor and not an employee of any company, and
      possesses the necessary skills and experience to provide the services
      described herein.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">RECITALS:</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">WHEREAS, Developer
      has developed a CLI application (the "Application") and wishes to sell and
      transfer the Application to Client; and</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">WHEREAS, Client
      wishes to purchase the Application and agrees to the terms and conditions
      set forth in this Agreement.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">NOW, THEREFORE, in
      consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the
      parties agree as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Development of CLI Application. Developer agrees to develop, and
        deliver the CLI Application to Client in accordance with Client's
        specifications as outlined in Exhibit A attached hereto. Developer shall
        use its best efforts to complete the development of the CLI Application
        within the agreed timeframe. Client acknowledges and agrees that any
        delays in providing information, approvals or feedback necessary for the
        CLI Applicationâ€™s development may result in a delay in the delivery of
        the CLI Application.</li>
      <li>Purchase of the CLI Application. Upon completion of the CLI
        Application, Client shall purchase the CLI Application from Developer
        for the purchase price of
        <span>{{purchase_price}} CAD</span>
        the " CLI Application Development Cost"), payable within 7 days after
        delivery of the CLI Application to the Client. Client acknowledges and
        agrees that the purchase price may be adjusted if Client requests
        additional features or changes to the CLI Application. If Client fails
        to pay any installment by the due date, Client shall be in default and
        Developer may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement and
        retain any amount paid by Client as liquidated damages. Additionally,
        Client shall pay a penalty fee of 5% of the purchase price for any late
        payment.</li>
      <li>Intellectual Property Rights. Developer shall retain all intellectual
        property rights to any work product created by Developer in connection
        with the development of the CLI Application, except for any intellectual
        property specifically licensed to Client as part of the CLI Application.
        Client shall have a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use such
        intellectual property solely in connection with the CLI Application.</li>
      <li>Hosting and Mantainance. Client shall be solely responsible for
        arranging for hosting services for the CLI Application. If Client
        chooses to have Developer provide hosting and maintenance services,
        Client and Developer must mutually agree on the monthly fee for such
        services. Client shall pay a monthly fee of
        <span>{{subscription_price}} CAD</span>
        for hosting and maintenance services to Developer on the first day of
        every month. If Client fails to pay the monthly fee by one week, a 15%
        late fee of the monthly fee will be added to the invoice. If Client
        fails to pay the monthly fee for two weeks, Developer may discontinue
        hosting and maintenance services. Client may terminate the hosting and
        maintenance services at any time by providing written notice to
        Developer.</li>
