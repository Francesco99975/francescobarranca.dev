    <h1>PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR WEBSITE DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT</h1>

    <p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">This agreement (the "Web
      Development Contract") is entered into between
      <span>{{dev_name}}</span>, an individual with a mailing address at
      <span>{{dev_address}}</span>
      ("Developer"), and
      <span>{{client_name}}</span>, an individual or entity with a mailing
      address at
      <span>{{client_address}}</span>
      ("Client"), collectively referred to herein as the "Parties". Developer is
      an independent contractor and not an employee of any company, and
      possesses the necessary skills and experience to provide the services
      described herein.</p>

    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">RECITALS:</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">WHEREAS, Client
      wishes to purchase the development of a website from Developer.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">WHEREAS, Developer
      agrees to develop the website for Client subject to the terms and
      conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5rem; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">NOW, THEREFORE, in
      consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the
      parties agree as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Development of Website. Developer agrees to design, develop, and
        deliver the Website to Client in accordance with Client's specifications
        as outlined in Exhibit A attached hereto. Developer shall use its best
        efforts to complete the development of the Website within the agreed
        timeframe. Client acknowledges and agrees that any delays in providing
        information, approvals or feedback necessary for the Website's
        development may result in a delay in the delivery of the Website.</li>
      <li>Purchase of the Website. Upon completion of the Website, Client shall
        purchase the Website from Developer for the purchase price of
        <span>$ {{purchase_price}} CAD</span>
        (the "Web Development Cost"), payable within 7 days after delivery of
        the Website to the Client. Client acknowledges and agrees that the
        purchase price may be adjusted if Client requests additional features or
        changes to the Website. If Client fails to pay any installment by the
        due date, Client shall be in default and Developer may, in its sole
        discretion, terminate this Agreement and retain any amount paid by
        Client as liquidated damages. Additionally, Client shall pay a penalty
        fee of 5% of the purchase price for any late payment.</li>
      <li>Intellectual Property Rights. Developer shall retain all intellectual
        property rights to any work product created by Developer in connection
        with the development of the Website, except for any intellectual
        property specifically licensed to Client as part of the Website. Client
        shall have a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use such intellectual
        property solely in connection with the Website.</li>
      <li>Domain Name and Hosting. Client shall be solely responsible for
        acquiring and providing a domain name for the Website, and for arranging
        for hosting services for the Website. If Client chooses to have
        Developer provide hosting and maintenance services, Client and Developer
        must mutually agree on the monthly fee for such services. In this case,
        a monthly amount of
        <span>$ {{subscription_price}} CAD</span>
        . Client shall pay the monthly fee for hosting and maintenance services
        to Developer on the first day of every month. If Client fails to pay the
        monthly fee by one week, a 15% late fee of the monthly fee will be added
        to the invoice. If Client fails to pay the monthly fee for two weeks,
        Developer may discontinue hosting and maintenance services. Client may
        terminate the hosting and maintenance services at any time by providing
        written notice to Developer.</li>
      <li>Acceptance and Testing. Developer shall make the Website available to
        Client for acceptance testing. Client shall have 7 days to test and
        accept the Website. If Client finds any errors or defects during the
        acceptance testing period, Client shall provide written notice to
        Developer specifying such errors or defects. Developer shall promptly
        correct such errors or defects.</li>
      <li>Representations and Warranties. Developer represents and warrants
        that: (a) Developer has the necessary expertise and skill to perform the
        services required under this Agreement; (b) the Website shall be
        designed and developed in a professional and workmanlike manner; (c) the
        Website shall be free from any viruses or other harmful code; and (d)
        the Website shall not infringe on any third party intellectual property
        rights.</li>
      <li>Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge and agree that during the
        course of this agreement, each party may disclose certain confidential
        information to the other party. Confidential information means any and
        all information disclosed by one party to the other party, whether
        orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that, under
        the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, should reasonably be
        understood to be confidential. The receiving party shall use the
        confidential information solely for the purpose of performing its
        obligations under this agreement and shall not disclose such
        confidential information to any third party without the prior written
        consent of the disclosing party, except to its employees, agents, and
        subcontractors who have a need to know such confidential information for
        the purpose of performing its obligations under this agreement and who
        are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those
        contained herein. The receiving party shall take all reasonable steps to
        protect the confidentiality of the confidential information, including
        but not limited to, implementing and maintaining appropriate
        administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent
        unauthorized access to or disclosure of the confidential information.
        This confidentiality obligation shall survive the termination or
        expiration of this agreement for a period of three (3) years.</li>
      <li>Indemnification. Developer agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold
        harmless Client and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from
        any and all claims, damages, and expenses (including reasonable
        attorney's fees) arising out of or in connection with Developer's breach
        of any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement.</li>
      <li>Limitation of Liability. In no event shall Developer be liable for any
        consequential, special, indirect, or punitive damages arising out of or
        in connection with this Agreement, even if Developer has been advised of
        the possibility of such damages. Developer's total liability to Client
        under this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase Price.</li>
      <li>Digital Assets. Client acknowledges and agrees that it is solely
        responsible for providing Developer with any digital assets or
        information necessary for the development of the Website, including but
        not limited to logos, pictures, and text.</li>
      <li>Publicity. Developer is free to use the Website in its professional
        portfolio after the Website has been made public. Developer does not
        require any credit or attribution specified on the Website.</li>
      <li>Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay
        in performance under this Agreement if such failure or delay is caused
        by acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, embargoes, government
        regulations, strikes, labor disputes, illness, or other similar causes
        beyond the reasonable control of such party.</li>
      <li>Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. Any dispute
        arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario, Canada.</li>
      <li>Dispute Resolution: Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of
        or relating to this agreement, including but not limited to, the breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, shall be
        resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties. If the
        parties are unable to resolve the dispute through negotiations within
        thirty (30) days, either party may request mediation. The parties shall
        select a mutually agreeable mediator and shall share equally in the
        costs of mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, either party may
        initiate arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with the
        Canadian Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules and
        procedures. The arbitration shall take place in the province of Ontario,
        Canada and shall be conducted by a single arbitrator appointed in
        accordance with the Canadian Arbitration Association's rules. The
        decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties,
        and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        The prevailing party in any arbitration or litigation arising out of
        this agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys'
        fees and costs incurred in connection with such proceeding. This dispute
        resolution clause does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive
        relief to prevent irreparable harm pending the outcome of any dispute
        resolution process.</li>
      <li>Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
        between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
        negotiations, understandings, and agreements, whether written or oral,
        between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.</li>
      <li>Amendments. This agreement may not be modified, amended, or
        supplemented except in writing signed by both parties. Any attempt to
        modify, amend, or supplement this agreement except as expressly provided
        herein shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either
        party may request changes to this agreement, provided that such changes
        shall be in writing and shall identify the specific provisions to be
        modified, the reasons for such modifications, and the proposed changes.
        Upon receipt of such a request, the parties shall use their best efforts
        to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution. Any modification or
        amendment to this agreement shall be effective only if it is in writing
        and signed by both parties.</li>
      <li>Counterparts. This agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
        which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
        constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile, electronic, and
        scanned copies of signatures shall be deemed equivalent to original
        signatures for purposes of this agreement. This agreement may be
        executed and delivered by facsimile, electronic mail, or other
        electronic means, and such execution and delivery shall be deemed valid
        and binding upon the parties hereto as if an original executed and
        delivered document.</li>
      <li>Termination: Either party may terminate this agreement upon written
        notice to the other party if: a) The other party breaches any material
        term or condition of this agreement and fails to cure such breach within
        thirty (30) days of written notice specifying the breach; or b) The
        other party becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of
        creditors, or if any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws
        is commenced by or against the other party. Upon termination of this
        agreement, the developer shall provide the client with all necessary
        passwords, access codes, and related information regarding the website.
        The client shall be responsible for any fees or expenses incurred by the
        developer up to the date of termination. All provisions of this
        agreement that by their nature should survive termination, shall
        survive, including but not limited to, ownership provisions, warranty
        disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</li>
